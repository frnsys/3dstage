Exports frames of a GLTF model to generate a gif.

To use:

1. In `main.js`, set `MODEL` to the path to your GLTF model.
2. Open `index.html`
3. When the model finishes rotating, you will be prompted to download `frames.zip`. Download and extract it.
4. Run `makegif.sh` to generate the gif (`out.gif`).
